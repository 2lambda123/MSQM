**The one-point model: solving equations in pointland**

In the one-point model we consider a zero-dimensional space.
The advantage of this model is that the many-body equations simplify enormously and can be solved analytically.
In particular, the one-body Greenʼs function is a solution of a set of functional integro-differential equations, which relate the one-particle Greenʼs
function to its functional derivative with respect to an external potential [1].
In the one-point model, these equations become ordinary differential equations that are solvable with standard techniques. 
This allows us to analyze several aspects of these equations as well as of standard methods for determining the one-body Greenʼs function, such as GW, that are important for real systems.
For example, it allows us to investigate the problem of unphysical solutions of the many-body equations [2].

**Path integral for the quartic oscillator: An approximate analytic expression for the partition function**

Using a path integral formalism 
we derive an approximate analytic expression for the partition function of the quartic anharmonic oscillator $V(x) = \frac{1}{2} 
\omega^2 x^2 + g x^4$. From the partition function we also derive explicit expressions for the ground-
and first-excited state energies $E_0(g)$ and $E_1(g)$, respectively. 
Quite remarkably, these energies are found to be accurate for the whole range
of the coupling constant $g$. In addition, both the weak- and strong-coupling expansions are qualitatively 
reproduced.
We believe that 
our approximate explicit partition function reproducing the key features of the exact partition function 
defines an interesting model to investigate 
the properties of the quartic oscillator.

**How delocalised are the polyacenes?**

The polyacenes or $n$-acenes consist of $n$ linearly fused benzene rings, and include benzene itself, naphthalene, anthracene, tetracene, etc.  Their $\sigma$ electrons are well localised into C-C and C-H bonds and their $\pi$ electrons are delocalised over the entire molecule.  At least, that is what many of us teach our undergraduate students.  But is it true?  In this lecture, I will report calculations in which the $\pi$ electrons are artificially confined into localised orbitals and I will use the resulting energy increase — the localisation energy — as a measure of the degree to which the $\pi$ electrons want to be delocalised.  The results suggest that we may need to update our undergraduate lectures…

**Model systems for discretization error analysis**

In the first part of my talk, I will present a detailed analysis of the famous error cancellation phenomenon in electronic structure calculation on the example of a 1D Hamiltonian with Dirac-delta potentials and periodic boundary conditions [1]. In the second part of my talk, I will illustrate the importance of continuous spectrum (scattering states) in quantum chemistry by numerical calculations based on the explicit knowledge of the bound states of the hydrogen atom [2].

**One-dimensional model with delta-type interactions: Dirac's equation with QED interactions**

It is important to take into account the effects of special relativity in the quantum description of chemical systems with heavy elements. The relativistic effects account for gold’s color, mercury’s liquid state at room temperature and are responsible for the efficiency of lead-acid batteries in cars [1]. Relativistic electronic-structure computational methods have been developed in the no-pair approximation, and are now routinely applied on molecular systems. Hence, the next challenge is to go beyond the no-pair approximation by including the quantum-electrodynamics (QED) effects of virtual electron-positron pairs. Such description is needed to recover some properties, even in very simple systems, e.g. the Lamb shift in the Hydrogen atom.
In this work we are interested in a one-dimensional model of relativistic hydrogen-like atom using delta-potential interactions. It is motivated by the non-relativistic version of this model which leads to the same ground-state energy and radial wave function as the three-dimensional one [2]. In this model we are able to make accurate QED calculations [3]. After calculating the spectrum of the 1D Dirac operator [4]
$$
\boldsymbol{\mathrm{D}}(x) = -\mathrm{i} c \boldsymbol{\sigma}_1 \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} x} + \boldsymbol{\sigma}_3 m c^2  -Z \delta(x)
$$
in first quantization, we develop an effective QED Hamiltonian in a fermionic Fock-space. This effective QED theory includes the effects of the vacuum polarization but does not include the photon degrees of freedom [5,6,7]. Within this framework we are able to calculate the vacuum-polarization density and the QED Lamb-type shift of the bound-state energy.
