# News

* **Sep 2023:** The MSQM 2024 website is up and running!

# GDR NBODY

The [GDR NBODY](https://wiki.lct.jussieu.fr/gdrnbody) - problème quantique à N corps en chimie et physique - created in 2019, is a research network that aims to bring together the community working on the quantum N-body problem, mostly from the viewpoint of quantum chemistry, but also including the viewpoints of condensed-matter physics, nuclear physics, and mathematics. The idea is to foster the development of new computational methods in quantum mechanics, the transfer of these methods from one discipline to another, and their efficient computer implementations.

# The MSQM Workshop

Model systems in quantum mechanics that are exactly or almost exactly solvable (such as 1D and lattice models) are important for the 
understanding and development of computational methods. This workshop aims to describe some of these models used in quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics, and nuclear physics. The workshop will include both pedagogical talks and research talks.

Examples of topics covered:
- Dimer and periodic Hubbard models
- Models of fermions on spheres
- Hooke's atomic model
- One-point model
- 1D Dirac-delta interaction model
- 1D time-dependent models
- Electron-boson models
- nuclear-physics models (Lipkin, ...)
- ...

# Registration

Registration is **open**. Please, email <loos@irsamc.ups-tlse.fr> to register and submit your title and abstract if you would to contribute (30min talks & posters are available). There is no registration fee. **Deadline for contributions: Nov 1st 2023**.

Due to budget limitations, the number of participants is limited to 40 (lunches and coffee breaks will be provided).
Quick fingers first!
